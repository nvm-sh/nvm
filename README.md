## Installation and Updates

### Quick Install

For a hassle-free installation, use the following script:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.2/install.sh | bash
```

Or, if you prefer `wget`:

```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.2/install.sh | bash
```

### Advanced Installation

For power users who need more control, clone the repository manually:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git ~/.nvm
cd ~/.nvm
git checkout v0.40.2
```

Then, add the following to your shell profile:

```sh
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \ . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

### Verifying Installation

Ensure NVM is installed correctly:

```sh
command -v nvm
```

If the output is `nvm`, you're good to go!

---

## Core Features

### Effortless Version Switching

Switching Node.js versions is as simple as:

```sh
nvm use 18
# Now using node v18.0.0
```

Want to install and use a specific version? No problem:

```sh
nvm install 16
# Now using node v16.14.0
```

### Global Package Migration

Preserve your global packages when switching Node.js versions:

```sh
nvm install 14 --reinstall-packages-from=12
```

### Customizing Your Environment

Tailor NVM to your workflow by setting environment variables like `NVM_COLORS` and `NVM_DIR`. For example:

```sh
export NVM_COLORS="bg=blue;fg=white"
```

### Working with `.nvmrc` Files

Standardize Node.js versions across your team by using `.nvmrc` files:

```sh
echo "16" > .nvmrc
nvm use
```

---

## Pro Tips for Power Users

### Optimizing Shell Performance

Speed up your shell startup by lazy-loading NVM. Add this snippet to your profile:

```sh
export NVM_LAZY_LOAD=true
```

### Using NVM in CI/CD Pipelines

Integrate NVM into your CI/CD workflows for consistent environments:

```sh
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
npm ci
npm test
```

### Leveraging Node Binary Mirrors

Work in restricted environments by using custom Node.js mirrors:

```sh
export NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://custom-mirror.com/node/
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Fixes

- **Problem**: `nvm: command not found`
  **Solution**: Ensure your shell profile is sourcing NVM correctly.

- **Problem**: Slow shell startup.
  **Solution**: Enable lazy loading with `export NVM_LAZY_LOAD=true`.

### macOS-Specific Tips

If you're using `zsh`, ensure your `.zshrc` includes:

```sh
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \ . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```
