# Security

Please file a private vulnerability report via GitHub, email [@ljharb](https://github.com/ljharb), or see https://tidelift.com/security if you have a potential security vulnerability to report.

**Escalation**

If you do not receive an acknowledgement of your report within 6 business days, or if you cannot find a private security contact for the project, you may escalate to the OpenJS Foundation CNA at `security@lists.openjsf.org`.

If the project acknowledges your report but does not provide any further response or engagement within 14 days, escalation is also appropriate.


## OpenSSF CII Best Practices

[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/684/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/684)

There are three “tiers”: passing, silver, and gold.

### Passing
We meet 100% of the “passing” criteria.

### Silver
We meet 100% of the “silver” criteria.

### Gold
We meet 78% of the “gold” criteria. The gaps are as follows:
  - because we only have one maintainer, the project has no way to continue if that maintainer stops being active.
  - We do not include a copyright or license statement in each source file. Efforts are underway to change this archaic practice into a suggestion instead of a hard requirement.
